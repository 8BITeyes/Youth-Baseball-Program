/* 1. The line-up should include batting order and player’s defensive positions for each of the five innings.

2. Each team shall play all players in the field in defensive positions. Additional players, (short fielders), shall be
positioned in the outfield no closer than 20 feet to the baseline when the ball is hit and will be considered
outfielders.

3. Each player must be scheduled to play an infield position at least one (1) inning. Catcher will be considered an
infield position. A player may only be scheduled to play catcher a maximum of one (1) inning per game. No
player may play a second inning of infield until every other player has played one inning of infield.

4. A player cannot play the same defensive position for more than one (1) inning per game.

5. A player can only sit out one (1) inning per game.
